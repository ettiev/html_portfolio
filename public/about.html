<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello!!</p>

<p>A bit about myself... I am in the process of transitioning into a Web Development career. I have travelled to many placed around the world and I have a mild coffee ☕ addiction.</p>

<h3>Hard Skills</h3>
<p>I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner. I am currently in the process of learning more and more skills that would help in a Web Development context.</p>

<h3>Further Soft Skills</h3>
<p>Life experiences have taught me much. I have had experience in public speaking and teaching. I have led various teams and managed international projects. I am comfortable communicationg and working in cross-cultural environments. Through experience I have also developed strategic planning and administrative skills.</p>

<h3>Hobbies and Travel</h3>  
<p>I was born and brought up in South Africa. For more than a decade I have constantly been travelling the world, visiting a variety of countries, including India, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Israel, Turkey, the Philippines, Romania, the United States, Lesotho, Mongolia, Qatar, China, Hong Kong, Serbia – and having the privilege of living in several of these countries for extended periods of time. I love experiencing different cultures, trying new foods and learning more about different worldviews.</p>
<p>I have a special love for India. Although the country might seem chaotic at first glance, the country have so many hidden treasures and the country truly teaches you to find beauty in the small things. The people are friendly and hospitable. There are amazingly beautiful areas like the Niligiri mountains, the region around Darjeeling and states like Kerala – with beautiful beaches and backwaters.</p>
<p>I enjoy spending time with friends! I have been blessed with amazing friends around the world!</p>
<p>I love drinking coffee! It really does not feel like a day could start properly if it does not start with coffee!</p>
<p>I enjoy watching movies and series – which just really helps me to switch off from reality and relax a bit!</p>
<p>Earlier I did a lot of Geocaching – which is a lot like a global treasure hunt and involves solving puzzles and searching and finding hidden caches. It has really taken me to a lot of interesting places!</p>

<h3>Another aspect of who I am...</h3>
<p>Another important aspect of who I am is my faith. I am a Christian. I believe that I have been called to serve God wherever I find myself. I see my faith journey as an adventure, in which I get to seek out the path that God has for me in this world. I believe I am continually growing in my understanding of who God is and who He has created me to be – and therefore I know I have not arrived at any kind of destination, regarding my faith, but am in a continual process of growth of character and discovery – till the day I die.</p>
