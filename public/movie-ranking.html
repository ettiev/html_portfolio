  <h2>My Favourite Movies:</h2> 
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings Series</h3>
      <p>This movie is an inspiring story of how a young hobbit did so much more than he ever thought he could. He went on a journey that was far bigger than he ever thought he could. He took the journey step by step and the people alongside him helped him along the way. It is a reminder to me of how life is a journey and step by step me need to move throught life. Life is an adventure - and we are to enjoy the journey and in the end we will do things and go to places we never thought we could!</p>
    <h3>Narnia Series</h3>
      <p>The Narnia series is also very inspirational to me. I am again reminded that there is much more to life than what we see with our physical eyes - and that I have been called to live out this adventure of life - fighting battles, overcome challenges and rise to be the best version of myself.</p>
    <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
      <p>This musical movie is a wonderful reminder of what is important in life. Life is not about money and fortune - life is about the people and the journey! The songs are inspiring!</p>
